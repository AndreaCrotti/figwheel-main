  <p><strong>TLDR</strong>: you can find and edit this file at <code>resources/public/index.html</code></p>

<p>This page is currently hosting your application code and REPL (Read
Eval Print Loop). As you change your code and save it, the
changed code will be hot loaded into this browser page.</p>

<p>If you return to the terminal where you launched <code>figwheel</code> and enter
valid ClojureScript code at the <code>cljs.user=&gt;</code> prompt, the code will be
compiled to Javascript and evaluated in the JavaScript environment on
this page.</p>

<p>If you close this page the REPL will cease to function.</p>

<h1 id="editing-this-indexhtml">Editing this index.html</h1>

<p>When you view the content of <code>resources/public/index.html</code> there will
be comments that show you how to remove this initial content. It is
important that you keep the final <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that requires your compiled
ClojureScript code.</p>
