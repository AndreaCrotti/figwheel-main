A rough outline to track the documentation I'd like to write.

At first this will be a rough list of subjects.

* advanced compile
* ring handler
* seperate server

* setting up emacs
* setting up vscode
* setting up vi fireplace

* usage
* How to use HTTPS
* How to override the jetty version (to use with Datomic Cloud)

* Command line options detatiled overview
* Modules and Code Splitting 
* REPL session management
* Testing patterns
