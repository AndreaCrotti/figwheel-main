A rough outline to track the documentation I'd like to write.

At first this will be a rough list of subjects.

* creating a build
* project layout and the classpath
* getting help
* quickish start


* How to use HTTPS
* How to override the jetty version (to use with Datomic Cloud)






* Command line options detatiled overview
* Modules and Code Splitting 
* REPL session management
* Testing patterns
