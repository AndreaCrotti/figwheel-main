A rough outline to track the documentation I'd like to write.

At first this will be a rough list of subjects.

* update Emacs.md so that folks understand the libs need to be top level
  in deps.edn

* using npm modules
* ring handler
* seperate server

* setting up vscode
* setting up vi fireplace

* usage
* How to use HTTPS

* Command line options detatiled overview
* REPL session management

* using an init script to start garden compiles
